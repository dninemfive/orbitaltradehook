		<label>Orbital Trade Hook is going away!</label>
		<description>Orbital Trade Hook is going to be folded into the Steam download for Deconstruct Return Fix as I combine all my patches into a single framework. The page will go private on November 5, 2019.\n\nI'd appreciate it if you commented telling me why you're using this mod, by the way; I'm not aware of anything making use of it yet.</description>
